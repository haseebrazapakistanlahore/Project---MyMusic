# Project---MyMusic
I developed the MyMusic app in Java using Android Studio. The app allows users to adjust song duration, navigate to previous and next songs, and includes a list view for browsing the playlist. This project enhanced my Android development skills, focusing on creating a user-friendly and intuitive music experience.
